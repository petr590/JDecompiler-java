Fixed decompilation of if-else

The API of the StringWritable and Stringified interfaces has been redesigned, now they work via generics,
and any objects that implement the necessary interfaces can be passed to the methods of the StringifyOutputStream class.

The system of constants has been redesigned. A bunch of code was moved from the ConstOperation class to ConstValueConstant,
which made it possible to recognize constants of primitive types and String in annotations where there are no operations.
Fixed constant referencing to itself.

Added recognition of constants MAX_VALUE, MIN_VALUE, MIN_NORMAL, POSITIVE_INFINITY, NEGATIVE_INFINITY, NaN, Math.PI, Math.E
for int, long, float and double types. Fixed the conversion of float and double to a string, now output is Float.NaN or Double.NaN.
If these constants cannot be used, then 0.0 / 0.0 is output. For plus and minus infinity, it is the same.
