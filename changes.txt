Added method signatures.

Fixed a bug where there is no declaration of the signature, but the signature itself is there.

Fixed a bug with the attribute type being defined as Stringified, it must be StringWritable.

Added field signatures.

---------- Debug ----------

Fixed the lack of import in annotations.

Added increment and decrement decompilation for javac17 compiler (eclipse compiles differently).

Fixed the instanceof operation (why didn't I add an operand to it?)

Fields with different signatures are now declared separately.

Fixed the definition of a ternary operator with complex conditions.
Now all operations marked removed are deleted before the scope is finalized, not at the end of decompilation.
Method Scope finalization has also been added.

Fixed ConcatStringsOperation (added "+").
