Added correct decompilation of constructors and constants in enum classes.

Fixed an import error when 2 classes with the same name could be imported.

Refactoring in the x590.util.Util class: some methods were moved to the x590.util.ArrayUtil class, javadoc was added to all methods.

The x590.util package is placed in a separate project, as it is used in other projects.

Package x590.jdecompiler is renamed to x590.jdecompiler.main
Package x590.javaclass is renamed to x590.jdecompiler along with all the sub packages.

Added module-info.java
