A small refactoring in the Main class.

Fixed a bug with the return type of bitwise operators that can work with boolean (&, |, ^).

Added autounboxing of types.

Added variable declaration.

Fixed a bug where the superclass for interface types was null, now always Object.

Fixed a bug with calling non-static methods: the object was removed from the stack before the arguments.

Fixed a bug with the casting of UncertainReferenceType

Added type conversion (was: `(byte)(int)longValue`, became: `(byte)longValue`)

Fixed reading of the Code attribute
Added variable names from LocalVariableTable (for now only for parameters)

The generic signature of the class has been added, and in general I have put things in order in reading signatures.

Fixed a bug with importing generic class.
