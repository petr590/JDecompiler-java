Refactoring the write-to-stream API:
- Removed almost all `write` methods to reduce code duplication
- The ExtendedOutputStream class was added, some of the methods from StringifyOutputStream were moved there
- The DisassemblingOutputStream class was added, similar to StringifyOutputStream, but works with the DisassemblingWritable interface
- StringWritable is now StringifyWritable
- Added methods printAll, printAllUsingFunction, printEach, printEachUsingFunction

Disassembly has not yet been fully implemented

In many attributes arrays have been replaced with immutable lists

Added lambda support (finally!)
