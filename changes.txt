Decompilation of nested class names has been fixed. Now each use of a nested class takes into account the context in which we use it.
For example, using the class `Outer.Middle.Inner` from the 'Outer` class gives `Middle.Inner`, and from the class `Outer.Middle` gives `Inner`.

Fixed a funny bug: the @Override annotation was hung on all methods of the Object class
(since the Object superclass is considered to be the Object itself, so that there is no NullPointerException),
as well as constructors, static methods, and even a static initializer! Carl!

Improved output of decompilation exceptions in the method comments.

Fixed a bug with string concatenation via StringBuilder when the stack was incorrect
due to an incorrectly spelled empty descriptor for StringConcatOperation

Fixed a bug when a method with a signature that declares throws, when outputting, wrote just throws without a list of declared exceptions

Fixed a bug with calling a method with one or more arguments followed by varargs.
When calling such a method with an empty varargs list, an extra comma was output.

Added decompilation of lambda references to methods

Added decompilation of anonymous classes

Added search for nested and anonymous classes in the same folder as the external class
