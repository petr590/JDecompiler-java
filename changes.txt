Refactoring: most of the fields are encapsulated, almost all classes in the x590 package.jdecompiler.operation declared as final.
Added functionality: the JavaField.setInitializer method is divided into set Static Initializer, set Instance Initializer, and the corresponding checks are added.

Improved security in the Java Class: now, when a decompilation stage is called again (read and disassemble, decompile, resolve imports, writing),
or if it was skipped, an exception is thrown.
