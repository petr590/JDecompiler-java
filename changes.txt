Improved the output of class members. Now if there is nothing in the enum except constants, a semicolon is not output.
The `static` modifier is not output for nested enums and interfaces, since they are always static.
When displaying synthetic fields, methods, classes, as well as bridge and autogenerated methods, the corresponding line in the comment is output.

Fixed decompilation of constructors of nested non-static classes.

Fixed the order of output of nested classes.

Fixed a bug with decompilation of lambdas that captured local variables.

Added decompilation of records

Added decompilation of `break` and `continue`
