Added the pre-decompilation stage and PreDecompilationContext. At this stage, there is a preliminary recognition of constructions of conditions, cycles, etc.
Not all the old code has been rewritten for this stage yet.

Added caching of all Java Class instances so that they can be retrieved from other JavaClass objects.
Decompilation of nested classes has been added.

Deprecated unused methods have been removed from the ClassInfo and ReferenceType classes.

Added the IClassinfo interface, which has 2 implementations - ClassInfo and PlainClassInfo
PlainClassInfo instances can be created from instances java.lang.Class
Added creation of Type instance from java.lang.Class (the method Type.fromClass(Class<?>))
All this was done in order to add an Override annotation for methods.

DecompilationStage class refactoring, added class DecompilationStage.DecompilationStageHolder.

Refactoring of other classes, fields, methods, etc.

Fixed a potential bug with NullPointerException in UncertainReferenceType
