Changed DecompilationAndStringifyContext API. Fixed bug with decompilation of initialization of non-static fields.

Fixed NullPointerException in NewArrayOperation class. The array has been replaced with a list, which simplifies iteration.

It is planned to add support for the PermittedSubclasses attribute.
