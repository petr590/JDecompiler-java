Added signature in throws (in java, you can specify a generic in the throws attribute)
Fixed reading of the type PrimitiveType.VOID in the Type.parseReferenceType(ExtendedStringReader) method

Fixed the ArrayLoadOperation - added conversion of the index to the int type

The dup instructions have been redesigned - now we don't create DupOperation, but duplicate the value directly,
so it's easier and you don't have to write operation.original() everywhere.

The constants were renamed to enum Type Size: ZERO_BYTES to VOID, FOUR_BYTES to WORD, EIGHT_BYTES to LONG.

Fixed initialization of arrays (the eclipse compiler does not assign null and 0 to arrays during initialization).

Added increment and shortened operators for array elements.

The call to the print method has been replaced with printPriotitied in the GetInstanceFieldOperation, PutInstanceFieldOperation classes,
Instance of Operation, CompareWithNullOperation
