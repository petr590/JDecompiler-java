Added decompilation of access methods to private members of nested classes generated by the compiler.
Added inlining methods.

Fixed a bug with variables when inlining methods.

Fixed a bug with infinite looping due to the fact that the Operation#deduceType method always returned true (due to comparing types via `==` and not via equals)

Added the -jdk option for decompiling jdk classes.

Fixed type of `this` in generic classes.

Fixed invocation of generic invokevirtual methods.

Fixed the clone() method call for arrays.
