Fixed decompilation of cycles with complex conditions. It was very difficult

Fixed methods such as Operation.isScope(). Previously, these methods were redefined in the corresponding subclass, now they are defined in the superclass, so encapsulation is easier and better.

The Instruction class has been redesigned into an interface, which made it possible to declare objects that are an operation and an instruction at the same time.

Fixed some bugs with annotations.

Refactoring: attribute names have been moved to the AttributeNames class, and the direct indication of the name has been replaced with a constant.
This is easier, and there is no possibility of making a mistake when entering the attribute name.
