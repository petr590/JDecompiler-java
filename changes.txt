Added support for loops (finally!). So far only `while` and `do while`

Added automatic path change in the version (maybe at least now I will stop forgetting to update it)

Fixed a bug with the order of operands in cmp operations.

Added a feature with shift operations. Was: `i << (int)l', became: `i << l` (this is possible in java).
