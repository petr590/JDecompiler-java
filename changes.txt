The && and || operators have been added, even decompilation of complex conditions has been added.

Fixed operator precedence in expressions like `!(a&&b)` (was `!a&&b`)
Fixed the priority of the not operator (was `!(a)`, it became `!a`)

Fixed some javadocs and added some new ones.

Fixed a bug with incorrect definition of abbreviated operators where they cannot be.
