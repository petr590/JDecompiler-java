Added decompilation finally// not done

Fixed a bug with InvokespecialOperation always returning the void type.

Fixed a bug when a variable was declared in a nested block, and after it another variable was declared in an external block.
In this case, the compiler puts both variables in the same slot, since they do not overlap.

Improved output of fields: now fields cannot be declared separated by commas if at least one of them is assigned a value.
Added a feature for displaying C-style arrays.

Wrappers have been added over variables so as not to redo an existing API.

Added loop decompilation (from code generated by a standard compiler), for recognition.

Added the class x590.jdecompiler.context.PreDecompilationContext, for the preDecompilation stage
Added postDecompilation stage for Operation

Operation is now an interface that is implemented by the AbstractOperation class. This made the API more flexible.

Improved decompilation of expressions like `integer1 + integer2` - removed unnecessary explicit conversions
Changed the Type#castToGeneral method, added the Type#castToGeneralNoexcept and Type#implicitCastToGeneralNoexcept methods
